1================

In order to get the "gradle publish" to work, you need to set up a few things.
The above lines need to be placed in a file at the following place:

    C:\Users\USERNAME\.gradle\gradle.properties

For USERNAME use the windows user you are logged into.  For unix the .gradle folder is in your user home directory.

2================

Download Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG) from https://gpg4win.org/thanks-for-download.html

Install.

3 ===============

You have to create a key for signing.   Create a key by using:

    gpg --gen-key
    
    real user name: (enter your first and last name, just descriptive)
    
    email: (enter you email address)
    
    Password: (you will be prompted for a signing password, and confirmation)

This will generate the key and display the results.   The output can be redisplayed by executing 

    gpg -K

The display will be something like

    ------------------------------------------------
    sec   ed25519 2021-12-31 [SC] [expires: 2023-12-31]
          XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXE8F13691
    uid           [ultimate] Keith Swenson <gpg@purplehillsbooks.com>
    ssb   cv25519 2021-12-31 [E] [expires: 2023-12-31]
    
Note the last 8 digits of the very long hex number.  You will need that as your keyId.

4 ==============

You need to send this key to a public keystore.   That is done with:

    gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys ########
    
Put your keyId in for the hash signs.

5 ==============

Generate the key ring that gradle needs to do the signing

   gpg --expoert-secret-keys ######## > c:/Users/USERNAME/.gradle/secret-keys.gpg
   
Again, replace the pound signs with your keyId.   This file is referenced in the config file above.

6 ==============

Sign up for a group ID and repository access with sonatype.org.  I don't have the instructions here, but fairly good ones are available if you search.   

From this you will need:

group id: this is 'com.purplehillsbooks.purple' for this library

userName: this is the user name you register there, called occasionally a Jira user it

password: the password you set.


7 =============

Update the .gradle/gradle.properties file, as mentioned at the top

signing.keyId=       the same 8 digits from the key
signing.password=    the password you set when generating the key
signing.secretKeyRingFile=//c:/Users/USERNAME/.gradle/secret-keys.gpg

ossrhUsername=       the user name from SonaType
ossrhPassword=       the password from SonaType


8 ============

If this is all set correctly, you can use the following command to upload a new version:

    gradle publish
    
Then you need to use the repository manager and RELEASE the staged repo to the official repo

    https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories
