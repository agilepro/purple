/**
 * <p>A JSONObject is an collection of name/value pairs.</p>
 *
 * <p> This com.purplehillsbooks.json version of the classes enforces alphabetical order
 * on the object members when being serialized.  This is done to put the output
 * into a cononical, reproducible form.  So that identical JSON objects will
 * produce identical output, and so that if you compare two JSON files, the
 * difference will be more meaningful.   Otherwise, the order of the members does
 * not matter.</p>
 *
 * <p> This com.purplehillsbooks.json version also provides human readible, indented output
 * when you use the <code>write(stream, indent, offset)</code> method.</p>
 *
 * <p>The JSONObject serialized
 * form is a string wrapped in curly braces with colons between the names and
 * values, and commas between the values and names. The internal form is an
 * object having <code>get</code> and <code>opt</code> methods for accessing the
 * values by name, and <code>put</code> methods for adding or replacing values
 * by name. The values can be any of these types: <code>Boolean</code>,
 * <code>JSONArray</code>, <code>JSONObject</code>, <code>Number</code>,
 * <code>String</code>, or the <code>JSONObject.NULL</code> object. A JSONObject
 * constructor can be used to convert an external form JSON text into an
 * internal form whose values can be retrieved with the <code>get</code> and
 * <code>opt</code> methods, or to convert values into a JSON text using the
 * <code>put</code> and <code>toString</code> methods. A <code>get</code> method
 * returns a value if one can be found, and throws an exception if one cannot be
 * found. An <code>opt</code> method returns a default value instead of throwing
 * an exception, and so is useful for obtaining optional values.</p>
 *
 * <p>The generic <code>get()</code> and <code>opt()</code> methods return an
 * object, which you can cast or query for type. There are also typed
 * <code>get</code> and <code>opt</code> methods that do type checking and type
 * casting for you. The opt methods differ from the get methods in that they do
 * not throw. Instead, they return a specified default value, such as null or zero.</p>
 *
 * <p>The <code>put</code> methods add or replace values in an object. For example,</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * JSONObject myObj = new JSONObject();
 * myObj.put(&quot;JSON&quot;, &quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
 * myObj.write( myWriter );
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>produces the string <code>{"JSON": "Hello, World"}</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p>The texts produced by the <code>write</code> methods strictly conform to
 * the JSON syntax rules. The constructors are more forgiving in the texts they
 * will accept:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>An extra <code>,</code>&nbsp;<small>(comma)</small> may appear just
 * before the closing brace.</li>
 * <li>Strings may be quoted with <code>'</code>&nbsp;<small>(single
 * quote)</small>.</li>
 * <li>Strings do not need to be quoted at all if they do not begin with a quote
 * or single quote, and if they do not contain leading or trailing spaces, and
 * if they do not contain any of these characters:
 * <code>{ } [ ] / \ : , = ; #</code> and if they do not look like numbers and
 * if they are not the reserved words <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, or
 * <code>null</code>.</li>
 * <li>Keys can be followed by <code>=</code> or <code>=&gt;</code> as well as by
 * <code>:</code>.</li>
 * <li>Values can be followed by <code>;</code> <small>(semicolon)</small> as
 * well as by <code>,</code> <small>(comma)</small>.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h1>Reading JSON Format</h1>
 *
 * <p>To read from a stream, reader, or string, use the following:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * JSONObject jo = new JSONObject( new JSONTokener( input ) );
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>To read from a file, it is most convenient:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * JSONObject jo = JSONObject.readFromFile( file );
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h1>Writing JSON Format</h1>
 *
 * <p>If you want to write to a stream, use the write methods on JSON object or array:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * jo.write( output );
 * -or-
 * jo.write( output, 2, 0 );
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>To write to a file.  This is more than just a convenience, this will write to a
 * temporary file, and then only when it is fully written, will delete the existing file,
 * and rename the temp to the new name:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * jo.writeToFile( file );
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Thus, no matter if the server crashes in the
 * middle of writing, the file being pointed to will always contain valid JSON format contents.
 * If the server crashes in the middle of writing, this may leave "temp" files in
 * the file system.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you have multiple programs running which will be updating a JSON file, please look
 * into LockableJSONFile for proper file system level locking of JSON files.</p>
 *
 * @see com.purplehillsbooks.json.LockableJSONFile
 * 
 *
 * <p>Originally written by JSON.org released 2012-10-26 but heavily modified
 * by Keith Swenson in the years after that to make the object classes
 * conform to style guidelines discussed in http://agiletribe.wordpress.com/</p>
