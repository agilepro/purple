/**
 * This class is for encoding values in order to make Java or JavaScript literal
 * expressions. If you are onstructing a web page that will have a JS script in
 * it, and you want to make a simple assignment statement like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * var t = &quot;properly formatted javascript literal expression&quot;;
 * </pre>
 *
 * But if you want that value to be variable, then given that you have the value
 * as a string in memory, you need to properly encode the value. If there are
 * any quote characters, they need to be escaped with a backslash. If there are
 * any newline characters, they need to be replaced with the appropriate
 * backslash expression. If there are Unicode characters >128, they need to be
 * encoded into hex value expressions. That is what this class will do.
 *
 * There are two ways: a writer and an encoding method. Both methods assume you
 * are constructing your java script expressions by writing them to a Writer
 * object. This is more efficient than concatenating strings together.
 *
 * 1. A Writer Instance. If you want to use a method that is prepared to write a
 * raw value to a Writer, and you want that raw value to be JavaScript encoded,
 * then you can construct a JAvaScriptWriter on your existing writer, and pass
 * JavaScriptWriter to the routine that will write the raw value. Every (raw)
 * value written will be converted as it is passed on to the wrapped Writer. An
 * example of this use is if you have a DOM tree (which can stream itself to a
 * Writer) but you want the serialized DOM to be placed into a JS literal form
 * on a web page. Passing the JAvaScriptWriter to the DOM for serialization will
 * mean that all the XML output will be properly escaped as a JavaScript
 * expression. The code that is writing the value does not know that the value
 * is going into a JavaScript literal expression ... it just writes.
 *
 * 2. A Static Method. If the value you want to convert is a string (as is often
 * the case) you don't need to construct a new object for this. Just call the
 * static encode method, passing a Writer and the string you want converted. The
 * string will be converted as it is written to the Writer.
 *
 * the Java to ccreate the above expression above might be:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Writer w; // given as the place the page is being written
 * String val = &quot;properly formatted javascript literal expression&quot;;
 * w.write(&quot;var t = \&quot;&quot;);
 * JavaScriptWriter.encode(w, val);
 * w.write(&quot;\&quot;;\n&quot;);
 * </pre>
 *
 * The val can be ANY legal String value, e.g. something a user typed in. The
 * output stream of characters will accurately represent the literal expression
 * for val. Note also that this does NOT do encoding for HTML in order to avoid
 * problems with HTML when putting JS within a web page. Consider using an
 * HTMLWriter inside this to take care of angle brackets and such.
