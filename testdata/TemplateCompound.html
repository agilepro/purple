Hello {{tester.name}},

People from {{address.primary.city}}, in {{address.primary.state}}, 
as well as {{address.secondary.city}}, in {{address.secondary.state}},
can clearly see values substituted into the text.

Since you are a {{tester.age}} year old {{tester.occupation}} you should
be able to see it too.

Goodbye
