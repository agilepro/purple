/**
 * This class is for encoding values in order to make make text appear in an
 * HTML page. This is not for creating HTML markeup. Instead you write text to
 * this writer, and it properly encodes everything so that what is seen on the
 * page is exactly what was written to this class.
 *
 * The example usage would be for a "comment" on a web page. A user writes a
 * comment using any variety of characters, including quotes and angle-brackets
 * which are characters that have a special meaning in HTML. What you want to do
 * is to have the comment displayed on the page exactly as the user input it.
 * But to do so, quote characters, and angle bracket characters must be properly
 * converted so that they are not mistaken for HTML markup by the browser.
 *
 * There are two ways: a writer and a static encoding method. Both ways assume
 * you are constructing your HTML by writing them to a Writer object. This is
 * more efficient than concatenating strings together.
 *
 * 1. A Writer Instance. If you want to use a method that is prepared to write a
 * raw value to a Writer, and you want that raw value to be HTML encoded, then
 * you can construct a HTMLWriter on your existing writer, and pass HTMLWriter
 * to the routine that will write the raw value. Every (raw) value written will
 * be converted as it is passed on to the wrapped Writer. An example of this use
 * is if you have a DOM tree (which can stream itself to a Writer) but you want
 * the serialized DOM to be displayed on a HTML web page (and not interpreted as
 * HTML by the browser). Passing the HTMLWriter to the DOM for serialization
 * will mean that all the XML output will be properly encoded as HTML markup so
 * that the resulting XML output will be displayed on the HTML page.
 *
 * 2. A Static Method. If the value you want to convert is a string (as is often
 * the case) you don't need to construct a new writer object for this. Just call
 * the static writeHtml method, passing a Writer and the string you want
 * converted. The string will be converted as it is written to the Writer.
 *
 * the Java code to to create a HTML page with a sample XML within it:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Writer w; // given as the place the page is being written
 * String val = &quot;&lt;a&gt;&lt;b&gt;value of b&lt;/b&gt;&lt;c&gt;value of c&lt;/c&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;;
 * w.write(&quot;&lt;p&gt;The sample XML expression is: &quot;);
 * HTMLWriter.writeHtml(w, val);
 * w.write(&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/n&gt;&quot;);
 * </pre>
 *
 * The val can be ANY legal String value, e.g. something a user typed in. The
 * output stream of characters will accurately converted to HTML so that the
 * value is displayed to the user.

	 * One solution is to use "PRE" tag to preserve the effect of newlines, but

	 *
	 * This method will convert raw text to equivalent HTML, so that the
	 * original text is displayed but with one embellishment: newline characters
	 * will be converted to a "BR" break tag, forcing the following text will
	 * start at the beginning of the next line. It is not a perfect solution,
	 * because not all text is formatted in this way that a newline always means
	 * the same as a break character, but for normal, casual blocks of text,
	 * like comments and short messages, this can work suitably.
