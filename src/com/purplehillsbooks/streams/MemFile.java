/**
 * Holds a stream of bytes in memory. It is a buffer that you can stream to, and
 * stream from, in either bytes or characters. More efficient than a byte array
 * since the bytes are not held in a contiguous array, and the bytes do not need
 * to be copied around in order to keep the byte array contiguous.
 * <p>
 * To write bytes to the memory file, either 1) Get an output stream and write
 * output to it 2) Instruct the memory file to fill itself from an InputStream
 * <p>
 * To read bytes from the memory file, either 3) Get an InputStream and read
 * from it 4) Instruct the memory file to write itself to an OutputStream.
 * <p>
 * For character-oriented reading & writing, only UTF-8 character encoding is
 * supported, because that is the only encoding that can represent the entire
 * Unicode set without loss.
 * <p>
 * For getting characters into a mem file you can: 5) Get a Writer to write
 * characters to the memory file 6) Instruct to read all chars from a Reader
 * into the mem file.
 * <p>
 * for getting characters out of a mem file, you can: 7) Get a Reader to read
 * characters from the memory file 8) Instruct to write all chars to a Writer.
 * <p>
 * Usage and Justification: The main usage is that you need to construct the
 * contents of a file programmatically, and then parse it, or alternately you
 * need to write something out, and the examine the results. In both cases you
 * needed a temporary buffer to hold the output/input. Often in Java a
 * StringBuffer is used for this but that is (1) inefficient/slow, and (2)
 * character oriented when you need bytes. The common practice of storing bytes
 * in characters causes a lot of confusion and bugs. Programmers tend to want to
 * use String for everything since they are the basic building block so of any
 * programs, but constructing a long string programmatically, by building
 * substring and putting them together in a recursive way is very inefficient,
 * and the string is copied many times in the process.
 * <p>
 * To compose something from strings in memory, use this approach:
 *
 * <pre>
 * MemFile mf = new MemFile();
 * Writer w = mf.getWriter();
 * w.write(&quot;This is the first line\n&quot;);
 * w.write(&quot;This is the second line\n&quot;);
 * w.write(&quot;This is the third line\n&quot;);
 * // then use getReader() or getInputStream() to pass to a method that consumes
 * // the file as if it was a stream.
 * </pre>
 *
 * Threading: MemFile should be used and accessed only from a single thread.
 * Program should input everything to the mem file, and then read everything.
 * Helper classes for InputStream and OutputStream will not necessarily return
 * the right values if input is done at the same time as output.
 * <p>
 * <i>Why not use a StringBuffer?</i> Because a StringBuffer is optimized for fast
 * conversion to a string, and to do this it keeps all the characters in a
 * single contiguous array. While you are filling the buffer, if it runs out of room, it
 * allocates a bigger contiguous array, and then copies the characters from the
 * old buffer to the new buffer. This can happen multiple times. MemFile will
 * never do this, because it does not require the bytes to be in a single
 * contiguous array.
 * <p>
 * What if you need a String to pass to a method. You can construct a string in
 * the normal way: Create a StringBuffer, create a StringBufferWriter, and ask
 * the MemFile to write the entire contents to that.  But once you start using
 * streams correctly, the need to convert them to strings is almost elminated.
