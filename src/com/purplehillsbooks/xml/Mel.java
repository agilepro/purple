/**
 * Mel = Mendocino Element
 *
 * The purpose of this class is to be a base class to classes which are designed
 * to be interfaced to DOM trees. If you have a DOM tree, and you want to
 * directly reflect that out to the program as structured data, you create a
 * file that has getters and setters for the various members. This base class
 * containes convenient methods for manipulating the DOM tree, and keeping it in
 * sync with the external representation you are presenting.
 *
 * GETTERS: pull values directly from child dom elements. Useful when a
 * particular member is gotten only a few times any reading of the file. If this
 * is a heavily used member, prefectch that to a cache member, and use that.
 * SETTERS: put value directly into child dom elements. If you have decided to
 * use a cache member for fast access, don't forget to update both the cache and
 * the dom tree.

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To assure atomic writing, the file is first output to a temporary file
     * that is the same name, but with a "tmp-###" appended to the end of the
     * name. Only when the entire tree is successfully output to the file, then
     * the file is renamed to the desired name.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If there was a file already there with that name, then that file will be
     * deleted, just before the temporary file is renamed to the desired name.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If your program crashes for any reason before the entire file is output,
     * the result will be that the previous version of the file will still be
     * there, and there will be a partially written file with a "tmp-###"
     * appended to the end. Since these are most likely fragments of the entire
     * file, they are not valid XML files, and can not be parsed. They should be
     * discarded, and the cause of the crash researched. There are no normal
     * situation that these files should be seen left in the file system.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Here is a specific example. If you want to write to a file with the path
     * "c:/data/MyConfig.cfg" the folder "c:/data" must exist. The output
     * routine will choose a random number, for example '137' and will write the
     * contents of the tree to "c:/data/MyConfig.cfg-tmp-137". Once the file is
     * completely output to disk, the old file "MyConfig.cfg" is deleted, and
     * the temp file is renamed to "MyConfig.cfg".
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * With this approach you are most likely to always have a valid file with
     * the desired name. There is an extremely small possibility that the
     * program might crash between the deletion of the old file, and the
     * renaming of the temp file, leaving you with no file at all with the
     * desired name. There is a very small window of time between these two
     * operations where another program or another thread might find the file
     * missing from the file system. This seems to be a limitation that we have
     * to live with until Java offer an atomic rename-and-delete-previous-file
     * operation.
